# AI-Generated Code Disclaimers
This is a repository that contains disclaimers for AI-generated code.

### Level 0 *(No disclaimer needed)*
I was used in the assisting of making code, but no code in the codebase is directly known to have been generated by an AI model of any kind.

### Level 1 *(AIG-1)*
AI was used in the writing of the code, and certain code snippets, functions, classes, structs, methods, or files have been generated by an AI model, but not the entire project.
This also includes the writing of documentation by an AI in the code (such as comments, docstrings, and type signatures).

### Level 2 *(AIG-2)*
AI was used in the writing of the code, and most of the code was written by an AI model.
This also includes the writing of documentation by an AI outside of the code (such as a README or wiki).

### Level 3 *(AIG-3)*
The entirety of the project has been created by an AI model, with the only human input being running the code, asking the AI to modify the code, etc.
