AI-GENERATED CODE DISCLAIMER (LEVEL 3)

The entirety of this project has been created by an artificial intelligence (AI)
model, with very minimal human input or intervention.

The user should be aware that the project was entirely generated by AI, so no safety,
reliability, or usability can be guarenteed with this code. It is recommended to
thoroughly review and test every and all portions of the code before use in any production
environment.
