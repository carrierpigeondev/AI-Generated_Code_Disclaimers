AI-GENERATED CODE DISCLAIMER (LEVEL 2)

Most of the code in this project has been generated by an artificial intelligence
(AI) model. This may include the writing of documentation by an AI outside of the
code, such as a README or wiki.

The user should be aware that a significant portion of the project was created
using AI, so extreme errors and inconsistencies may still exist. It is recommended
to thoroughly review and test the code before use in any production environment.
