AI-GENERATED CODE DISCLAIMER (LEVEL 1)

Certain code snippets, functions, classes, structs, methods, or files in this
project have been generated by an artificial intelligence (AI) model. This
may also include the writing of documentation by an AI in the code, such as
comments, docstrings, and type signatures.

The user should be aware that while AI was used in the creation of specific
components, not the entire project, caution should still be excerised when
running code.
